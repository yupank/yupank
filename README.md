### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on usage of AI for analysis of scientific data.

I'm experienced in C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and R. 
I have developed GUI-based applications for acquisition, visualisation and analysis of biophysical and neurophysiological data (C++ and Java)

ðŸŒ± I have completed the Nortcoders Bootcamp in Data Engineering and have got freeCodeCamp certificates in Data Analysis and Machine Learning with Python. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data engineering and data analysis projects

I have got MSc in Biophysics and PhD in Neurobiology
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how real neural networks are working...
